# ClockPositionRighteousifier
Put the clock back where it belongs (to the right of the notification icon) in Windows 10.

Simply drop a shortcut to the executable into your startup folder to run it automatically. If you launch the .exe a second time it will quit itself and undo the change it made. No warranties, etc.
